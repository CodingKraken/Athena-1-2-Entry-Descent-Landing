# Athena-Entry-Descent-Landing
The landing script for the Athena Program, my first Mars lander program.

If you want to try the script, download the athenaedl.ks script. The one with athenaedlcmt.ks is too large for the probe core.

The video showcasing a version of this script can be found here: https://youtu.be/DJgCj8iy--M
